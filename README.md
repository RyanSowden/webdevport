# Web Developer Portfolio

This is a basic responsive be developer portfolio someone could use to display there work as a developer or designer. This site is built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Jquery.

The site itself is fully responsive and will would across all browswer including mobile. I only gave three slots to display work but there is basically and infinite amount you could use but because it uses the bootstrap grid system just make sure your col numbers are always dividable by 12. If you run into any troubles feel free to send me a message and I can walk you through it.

As with all my work this them is 100% open source under the MIT licence , so feel free to use it, pull it apart, add to it and improve it, basically do what you want with it. If you can see any improvements I can make I would love to hear from you :)

Also if you want to edit any of the CSS make sure you only touch the style.css, you don't want to mess with the bootstrap stuff unless you know what you are doing, then in that case go right ahead :)
